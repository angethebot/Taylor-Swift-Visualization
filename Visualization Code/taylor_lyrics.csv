Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,He said the way my blue eyes shined
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"I said, ""That's a lie"""
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Just a boy in a Chevy truck
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,On back roads at night
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And I was right there beside him all summer long
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,But when you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,September saw a month of tears
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And thankin' God that you weren't here
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,To see me like that
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,But in a box beneath my bed
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Is a letter that you never read
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,From three summers back
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe"
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,The one we danced to all night long
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And I'm back for the first time since then
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I'm standin' on your street
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And there's a letter left on your doorstep
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And the first thing that you'll read is:
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"""When you think Tim McGraw"
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think my favorite song
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Someday you'll turn your radio on
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"I hope it takes you back to that place"""
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,When you think happiness
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think that little black dress
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Think of my head on your chest
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,And my old faded blue jeans
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,When you think Tim McGraw
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,I hope you think of me
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"Oh, think of me"
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Mmmm
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,He said the way my blue eyes shined
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Taylor Swift,Tim McGraw,"I said, ""That's a lie"""

Taylor Swift,Cold As You,You have a way of coming easily to me
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,"And when you take, you take the very best of me"
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,"Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say"
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through

Taylor Swift,Cold As You,You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,And you come away with a great little story
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Taylor Swift,Cold As You,"So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say"

Taylor Swift,The Outside,"You saw me there, but never knew"
Taylor Swift,The Outside,That I would give it all up to be
Taylor Swift,The Outside,"A part of this, a part of you"
Taylor Swift,The Outside,And now it's all too late. So you see

Taylor Swift,The Outside,I've never been on the outside
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
Taylor Swift,Tied Together With A Smile,But that's not true 'cause I know you

Taylor Swift,Our Song,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Asking God if he could play it again
Taylor Swift,Our Song,I was walking up the front porch steps
Taylor Swift,Our Song,After everything that day
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
Taylor Swift,Our Song,And lost and thrown away
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"Got to the hallway, well on my way"
Taylor Swift,Our Song,To my lovin' bed
Taylor Swift,Our Song,I almost didn't notice all the roses
Taylor Swift,Our Song,And the note that said
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Our song is the slamming screen door
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
Taylor Swift,Our Song,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Taylor Swift,Our Song,'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Our song is the way you laugh
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
Taylor Swift,Our Song,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Asking God if he could play it again
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Da-da-da-da
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"I've heard every album, listened to the radio"
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Waited for somethin' to come along
Taylor Swift,Our Song,That was as good as our song
Taylor Swift,Our Song,'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window"
Taylor Swift,Our Song,When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
Taylor Swift,Our Song,'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Our song is the way he laughs
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"""
Taylor Swift,Our Song,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Taylor Swift,Our Song,Asking God if he could play it again
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"Play it again, oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,Our Song,"Oh, oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,Our Song,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
Taylor Swift,Our Song,In the front seat of his car
Taylor Swift,Our Song,I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
Taylor Swift,Our Song,And I wrote down our song
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Friday night beneath the stars
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,In a field behind your yard
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,And sometimes we don't say a thing
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Just listen to the crickets sing
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Everything I need is right here by my side
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,And I know everything about you
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,I don't wanna live without you
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,I'm only up when you're not down
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,It's like no matter what I do
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Let you know that what I feel is true
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,And I'm only me when I'm with you
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Just a small-town boy and girl
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Living in a crazy world
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,And I don't try to hide my tears
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,My secrets or my deepest fears
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Through it all nobody gets me like you do
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,And you know everything about me
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,You say that you can't live without me
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,I'm only up when you're not down
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,It's like no matter what I do
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Let you know that what I feel is true
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,And I'm only me when I'm with you
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,When I'm with anybody else
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,It's so hard to be myself
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,And only you can tell
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,That I'm only up when you're not down
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,It's like no matter what I do
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,Let you know that what I feel is true
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"And I'm only me, who I wanna be"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"Well, I'm only me when I'm with you"
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,With you
Taylor Swift,I’m Only Me When I’m with You,"Uh-huh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,Invisible,She can't see the way your eyes
Taylor Swift,Invisible,Light up when you smile
Taylor Swift,Invisible,She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Taylor Swift,Invisible,Whenever she walks by
Taylor Swift,Invisible,And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her

Taylor Swift,Invisible,Miracle
Taylor Swift,Invisible,Unbelievable
Taylor Swift,Invisible,Instead of just invisible
Taylor Swift,Invisible,"Oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,Invisible,There's a fire inside of you
Taylor Swift,Invisible,That can't help but shine through
Taylor Swift,Invisible,She's never gonna see the light
Taylor Swift,Invisible,No matter what you do
Taylor Swift,Invisible,And all I think about is how to make you think of me
Taylor Swift,Invisible,And everything that we could be
Taylor Swift,Invisible,I just wanna show you
Taylor Swift,Invisible,She don't even know you
Taylor Swift,Invisible,She's never gonna love you like I want to

Taylor Swift,Invisible,"Oh, yeah"
Taylor Swift,Invisible,She can't see the way your eyes
Taylor Swift,Invisible,Light up when you smile
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Maybe I should've seen the signs
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Should've read the writing on the wall
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"No matter what you say, I still can't believe"
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,That you would walk away
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"It don't make sense to me, but"
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,It's not unbroken anymore
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,How do I get it back the way it was before?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Taylor Swift,A Perfectly Good Heart,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Taylor Swift,Teardrops on My Guitar (Pop Version),'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Taylor Swift,Teardrops on My Guitar (Pop Version),The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart

Speak Now ,Mine,"You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables"
Speak Now ,Mine,Left a small town and never looked back
Speak Now ,Mine,"I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling"
Speak Now ,Mine,"Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts"
Speak Now ,Mine,"I say, ""Can you believe it?"""
Speak Now ,Mine,As we're lying on the couch
Speak Now ,Mine,"The moment, I could see it"
Speak Now ,Mine,"Yes, yes, I can see it now"
Speak Now ,Mine,"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?"
Speak Now ,Mine,You put your arm around me for the first time
Speak Now ,Mine,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Speak Now ,Mine,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Speak Now ,Mine,"Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together"
Speak Now ,Mine,And there's a drawer of my things at your place
Speak Now ,Mine,You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
Speak Now ,Mine,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
Speak Now ,Mine,But we got bills to pay
Speak Now ,Mine,We got nothing figured out
Speak Now ,Mine,When it was hard to take
Speak Now ,Mine,"Yes, yes"
Speak Now ,Mine,This is what I thought about:
Speak Now ,Mine,"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?"
Speak Now ,Mine,You put your arm around me for the first time
Speak Now ,Mine,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Speak Now ,Mine,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Speak Now ,Mine,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
Speak Now ,Mine,You saw me start to believe for the first time
Speak Now ,Mine,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Speak Now ,Mine,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Speak Now ,Mine,"And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM"
Speak Now ,Mine,As everything was slipping right out of our hands
Speak Now ,Mine,"I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street"
Speak Now ,Mine,Braced myself for the goodbye
Speak Now ,Mine,'Cause that's all I've ever known
Speak Now ,Mine,"Then, you took me by surprise"
Speak Now ,Mine,"You said, ""I'll never leave you alone."""
Speak Now ,Mine,"You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water"
Speak Now ,Mine,"And every time I look at you, it's like the first time"
Speak Now ,Mine,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
Speak Now ,Mine,"She is the best thing that's ever been mine"""
Speak Now ,Mine,"Hold on, make it last"
Speak Now ,Mine,"Hold on, never turn back"
Speak Now ,Mine,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
Speak Now ,Mine,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Speak Now ,Mine,"Yeah, yeah"
Speak Now ,Mine,Do you believe it? (Hold on)
Speak Now ,Mine,We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
Speak Now ,Mine,And I can see it
Speak Now ,Mine,"Yeah, yeah"
Speak Now ,Mine,I can see it now (See it now)
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,And I'm a house of cards
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,You're the kind of reckless
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,That should send me running
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,But I kinda know that I won't get far
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,And you stood there in front of me
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Just close enough to touch
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Close enough to hope you couldn't see
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,What I was thinking of
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Drop everything now
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Meet me in the pouring rain
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Take away the pain
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,My mind forgets to remind me
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,You're a bad idea
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,You touch me once and it's really something
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,But with you I know it's no good
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Drop everything now
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Meet me in the pouring rain
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Take away the pain
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,And lead me up the staircase
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Won't you whisper soft and slow?
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,"I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show"
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Drop everything now
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Meet me in the pouring rain
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Kiss me on the sidewalk
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Take away the pain
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,And the sparks fly
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,"Oh, baby, smile"
Speak Now ,Sparks Fly,And the sparks fly
Speak Now ,Back to December,I'm so glad you made time to see me
Speak Now ,Back to December,"How's life? Tell me, how's your family?"
Speak Now ,Back to December,I haven't seen them in a while
Speak Now ,Back to December,"You've been good, busier than ever"
Speak Now ,Back to December,"We small talk, work and the weather"
Speak Now ,Back to December,Your guard is up and I know why
Speak Now ,Back to December,Because the last time you saw me
Speak Now ,Back to December,Is still burned in the back of your mind
Speak Now ,Back to December,"You gave me roses, and I left them there to die"
Speak Now ,Back to December,So this is me swallowing my pride
Speak Now ,Back to December,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
Speak Now ,Back to December,And I go back to December all the time
Speak Now ,Back to December,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Speak Now ,Back to December,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Speak Now ,Back to December,"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
Speak Now ,Back to December,I go back to December all the time
Speak Now ,Back to December,"These days, I haven't been sleeping"
Speak Now ,Back to December,"Staying up, playing back myself leaving"
Speak Now ,Back to December,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Speak Now ,Back to December,"And I think about summer, all the beautiful times"
Speak Now ,Back to December,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Speak Now ,Back to December,Realized I loved you in the fall
Speak Now ,Back to December,And then the cold came
Speak Now ,Back to December,The dark days when fear crept into my mind
Speak Now ,Back to December,"You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye"
Speak Now ,Back to December,So this is me swallowing my pride
Speak Now ,Back to December,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
Speak Now ,Back to December,And I go back to December all the time
Speak Now ,Back to December,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Speak Now ,Back to December,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Speak Now ,Back to December,"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
Speak Now ,Back to December,I go back to December all the time
Speak Now ,Back to December,"I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile"
Speak Now ,Back to December,"So good to me, so right"
Speak Now ,Back to December,And how you held me in your arms that September night
Speak Now ,Back to December,The first time you ever saw me cry
Speak Now ,Back to December,Maybe this is wishful thinking
Speak Now ,Back to December,Probably mindless dreaming
Speak Now ,Back to December,"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right"
Speak Now ,Back to December,"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't"
Speak Now ,Back to December,"So if the chain is on your door, I understand"
Speak Now ,Back to December,But this is me swallowing my pride
Speak Now ,Back to December,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
Speak Now ,Back to December,And I go back to December
Speak Now ,Back to December,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Speak Now ,Back to December,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
Speak Now ,Back to December,"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
Speak Now ,Back to December,"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
Speak Now ,Back to December,I go back to December all the time
Speak Now ,Back to December,All the time
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I am not the kind of girl
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Who should be rudely barging in
Speak Now ,Speak Now,On a white veil occasion
Speak Now ,Speak Now,But you are not the kind of boy
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I sneak in and see your friends
Speak Now ,Speak Now,And her snotty little family
Speak Now ,Speak Now,All dressed in pastel
Speak Now ,Speak Now,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Somewhere back inside a room
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Speak Now ,Speak Now,This is surely not
Speak Now ,Speak Now,What you thought it would be
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I lose myself in a daydream
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Where I stand and say
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"Don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Of the church at the back door
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now ,Speak Now,You need to hear me out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Fond gestures are exchanged
Speak Now ,Speak Now,And the organ starts to play
Speak Now ,Speak Now,A song that sounds like a death march
Speak Now ,Speak Now,And I am hiding in the curtains
Speak Now ,Speak Now,It seems that I was uninvited
Speak Now ,Speak Now,By your lovely bride-to-be
Speak Now ,Speak Now,She floats down the aisle
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Like a pageant queen
Speak Now ,Speak Now,But I know you wish it was me
Speak Now ,Speak Now,You wish it was me (Don't you)
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"Don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Of the church at the back door
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now ,Speak Now,You need to hear me out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"Don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Of the church at the back door
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Your time is running out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"Ooh, ooh"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,(Say a single vow)
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I hear the preacher say
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"""Speak now or forever hold your peace"""
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"There's the silence, there's my last chance"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Horrified looks from everyone in the room
Speak Now ,Speak Now,But I'm only looking at you
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I am not the kind of girl
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Who should be rudely barging in
Speak Now ,Speak Now,On a white veil occasion
Speak Now ,Speak Now,But you are not the kind of boy
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Speak Now ,Speak Now,(Hehe!)
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"So don't say yes, run away now"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I'll meet you when you're out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Of the church at the back door
Speak Now ,Speak Now,Don't wait or say a single vow
Speak Now ,Speak Now,You need to hear me out
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"And they said, ""speak now"""
Speak Now ,Speak Now,And you say
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"""Let's run away now"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I'll meet you when
Speak Now ,Speak Now,I'm out of my tux at the back door
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"Baby, I didn't say my vows"
Speak Now ,Speak Now,So glad you were around when they said
Speak Now ,Speak Now,"'Speak now'"""
Speak Now ,Dear John,Long were the nights when
Speak Now ,Dear John,My days once revolved around you
Speak Now ,Dear John,Counting my footsteps
Speak Now ,Dear John,Praying the floor won't fall through... again
Speak Now ,Dear John,My mother accused me of losing my mind
Speak Now ,Dear John,But I swore I was fine
Speak Now ,Dear John,You paint me a blue sky
Speak Now ,Dear John,Then go back and turn it to rain
Speak Now ,Dear John,And I lived in your chess game
Speak Now ,Dear John,But you changed the rules everyday
Speak Now ,Dear John,"Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight"
Speak Now ,Dear John,"Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why"
Speak Now ,Dear John,"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
Speak Now ,Dear John,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

Speak Now ,Better Than Revenge,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I still remember the look on your face
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Lit through the darkness at 1:58
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,The words that you whispered
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,For just us to know
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,You told me you loved me
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,So why did you go away?
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Away
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I do recall now the smell of the rain
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Fresh on the pavement
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I ran off the plane
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,That July 9th
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,The beat of your heart
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,It jumps through your shirt
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I can still feel your arms
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,But now I'll go sit on the floor
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Wearing your clothes
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,All that I know is
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I don't know how to be something you miss
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Never imagined we'd end like this
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,"Your name, forever the name on my lips"
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I do remember the swing of your step
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,"The life of the party, you're showing off again"
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,And I roll my eyes and then
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,You pull me in
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I'm not much for dancing
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,But for you I did
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,"Because I love your handshake, meeting my father"
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,And I'll go sit on the floor
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Wearing your clothes
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,All that I know is
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I don't know how to be something you miss
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I never imagined we'd end like this
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,"Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh"
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Hope it's nice where you are
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,And I hope the sun shines
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,And it's a beautiful day
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,And something reminds you
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,You wish you had stayed
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,You can plan for a change in weather and time
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,But I never planned on you changing your mind
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,So I'll go sit on the floor
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Wearing your clothes
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,All that I know is
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I don't know how to be something you miss
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Never imagined we'd end like this
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,"Your name, forever the name on my lips"
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Just like our last kiss
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Forever the name on my lips
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Forever the name on my lips
Speak Now ,Last Kiss,Just like our last
Speak Now ,Long Live,"I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind"
Speak Now ,Long Live,The time we stood with our shaking hands
Speak Now ,Long Live,The crowds in stands went wild
Speak Now ,Long Live,We were the kings and the queens
Speak Now ,Long Live,And they read off our names
Speak Now ,Long Live,The night you danced like you knew our lives
Speak Now ,Long Live,Would never be the same
Speak Now ,Long Live,You held your head like a hero
Speak Now ,Long Live,On a history book page
Speak Now ,Long Live,It was the end of a decade
Speak Now ,Long Live,But the start of an age
Speak Now ,Long Live,Long live the walls we crashed through
Speak Now ,Long Live,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Speak Now ,Long Live,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
Speak Now ,Long Live,And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now ,Long Live,"One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now ,Long Live,"I said, remember this feeling"
Speak Now ,Long Live,I passed the pictures around
Speak Now ,Long Live,Of all the years that we stood there
Speak Now ,Long Live,On the side-lines wishing for right now
Speak Now ,Long Live,We are the kings and the queens
Speak Now ,Long Live,You traded your baseball cap for a crown
Speak Now ,Long Live,When they gave us our trophies
Speak Now ,Long Live,And we held them up for our town
Speak Now ,Long Live,And the cynics were outraged
Speak Now ,Long Live,"Screaming, ""This is absurd"""
Speak Now ,Long Live,"'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves"
Speak Now ,Long Live,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Speak Now ,Long Live,Long live the walls we crashed through
Speak Now ,Long Live,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Speak Now ,Long Live,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
Speak Now ,Long Live,And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now ,Long Live,I'm not afraid
Speak Now ,Long Live,Long live all the mountains we moved
Speak Now ,Long Live,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Speak Now ,Long Live,"I was screaming, long live that look on your face"
Speak Now ,Long Live,And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now ,Long Live,"One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now ,Long Live,Hold on to spinning around
Speak Now ,Long Live,Confetti falls to the ground
Speak Now ,Long Live,May these memories break our fall
Speak Now ,Long Live,Will you take a moment?
Speak Now ,Long Live,Promise me this
Speak Now ,Long Live,That you'll stand by me forever
Speak Now ,Long Live,"But if, God forbid, fate should step in"
Speak Now ,Long Live,And force us into a goodbye
Speak Now ,Long Live,If you have children some day
Speak Now ,Long Live,When they point to the pictures
Speak Now ,Long Live,Please tell them my name
Speak Now ,Long Live,Tell them how the crowds went wild
Speak Now ,Long Live,Tell them how I hope they shine
Speak Now ,Long Live,Long live the walls we crashed through
Speak Now ,Long Live,"I had the time of my life, with you"
Speak Now ,Long Live,"Long, long live the walls we crashed through"
Speak Now ,Long Live,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
Speak Now ,Long Live,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
Speak Now ,Long Live,And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now ,Long Live,I'm not afraid
Speak Now ,Long Live,"Singing, long live all the mountains we moved"
Speak Now ,Long Live,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Speak Now ,Long Live,"And long, long live that look on your face"
Speak Now ,Long Live,And bring on all the pretenders
Speak Now ,Long Live,"One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now ,Ours,Elevator buttons and morning air
Speak Now ,Ours,Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
Speak Now ,Ours,"If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares"
Speak Now ,Ours,"But right now, my time is theirs"
Speak Now ,Ours,Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
Speak Now ,Ours,They'll judge it like they know about me and you
Speak Now ,Ours,And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
Speak Now ,Ours,"The jury's out, but my choice is you"

Speak Now ,Ours,You never know what people have up their sleeves
Speak Now ,Ours,Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Speak Now ,Ours,Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
Speak Now ,Ours,"But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine"
Speak Now ,Ours,And you'll say
Speak Now ,Ours,Don't you worry your pretty little mind
Speak Now ,Ours,People throw rocks at things that shine
Speak Now ,Ours,And life makes love look hard
Speak Now ,Ours,"The stakes are high, the water's rough"

Speak Now ,Ours,And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
Speak Now ,Ours,"And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong"
Speak Now ,Ours,And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
Speak Now ,Ours,With this song for you
Speak Now ,Ours,'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
Speak Now ,Ours,And I love the riddles that you speak
Speak Now ,Ours,And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Speak Now ,Ours,Will be ignored
Speak Now ,Ours,'Cause my heart is yours
Speak Now ,Ours,So don't you worry your pretty little mind
Speak Now ,Ours,People throw rocks at things that shine
Speak Now ,Ours,And life makes love look hard
Speak Now ,Ours,Don't you worry your pretty little mind
Speak Now ,Ours,People throw rocks at things that shine
Speak Now ,Ours,But they can't take what's ours
Speak Now ,Ours,They can't take what's ours
Speak Now ,Ours,"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
Speak Now ,Ours,But this love is ours

Speak Now ,If This Was a Movie,You'd be here by now
Speak Now ,If This Was a Movie,It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
Speak Now ,If This Was a Movie,"Baby, what about the ending?"
Speak Now ,If This Was a Movie,"Oh, I thought you'd be here by now"
Speak Now ,If This Was a Movie,Thought you'd be here by now

Red ,State of Grace,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Red ,State of Grace,Busy streets and busy lives
Red ,State of Grace,And all we know is touch and go
Red ,State of Grace,We are alone with our changing minds

Red ,Come Back... Be Here,"4 AM, the second day"
Red ,Come Back... Be Here,How strange that I don't know you at all
Red ,Come Back... Be Here,Stumbled through the long goodbye

Red ,Come Back... Be Here,I guess you're in London today
Red ,Come Back... Be Here,And I don't wanna need you this way
Red ,Come Back... Be Here,"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Red ,Come Back... Be Here,This is falling in love in the cruelest way

Red ,Come Back... Be Here,"But you're in London, and I break down"

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Tell me something awful
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Like you are a poet
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Trapped inside the body of a finance guy
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Tell me all your secrets
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,All you'll ever be is
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,My eternal consolation prize
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,You see I was a debutant
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,"In another life, but"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Now I seem to be scared to go outside
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,If comfort is a construct
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I don't believe in good luck
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Now that I know what's what

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Secret gardens in my mind
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,People need a key to get to
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,The only one is mine
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I hate it here
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,My friends used to play a game where
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,We would pick a decade
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,We wished we could live in instead of this
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists and getting married off for the highest bid
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Everyone would look down
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Cause it wasn't fun now
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Seems like it was never even fun back then
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Nostalgia is a mind's trick
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,"If I'd been there, I'd hate it"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,It was freezing in the palace
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I hate it here so I will go to
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Lunar valleys in my mind
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,When they found a better planet
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Only the gentle survived
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I dreamed about it in the dark
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,The night I felt like I might die
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I hate it here
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,"I'm lonely, but I'm good"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,"I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,This place made me feel worthless
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,"Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me and in my fantasies I rise above it"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,"And way up there, I actually love it"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,I hate it here so I will go to
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Secret gardens in my mind
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,People need a key to get to

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,"Quick, quick"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Tell me something awful
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Like you are a poet
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Hate It Here,Trapped inside the body of a finance guy
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,When I picture my hometown
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,"There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And a plaque underneath it
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And it was always the same searing pain
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,But I dreamed that one day I could say
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,All that time you were throwin' punches
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,I was buildin' somethin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,"Screamed, 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,As the blood was gushin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,But I can't forget the way you made me heal
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And it wasn't a fair fight
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Or a clean Kill
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Each time that aIMee stomped across my grave
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And then she wrote headlines
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,In the local paper laughing at each baby step I'd take
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And it was always the same searing pain
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,But I prayed that one day I could say
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,All that time you were throwin' punches
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,I was buildin' somethin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Screamed 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,As the blood was gushin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,But I can't forget the way you made me heal
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,But she used to say she wished that you were dead
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,I pushed each boulder up the hill
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,"Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,I built a legacy that you can't undo
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,But when I count the scars
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,There's a moment of truth
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,That there wouldn't be this
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,If there hadn't been you
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And maybe you've reframed it
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And in your mind you never beat my spirit black and blue
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,I don't think you've changed much
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And one day
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Your kid comes home singing
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,A song that only us two is gonna know is about you
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Cause
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,All that time you were throwin' punches
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,It was all for nothin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And our town it looks so small from way up here
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,"Screamed, 'thanK you aIMee'' to the night sky"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,And the stars are stunnin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,But she used to say she wished that you were dead
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,So I pushed each boulder up that hill
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,"Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,ThanK you aIMee
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,thanK you aIMee,ThanK you aIMee

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,I look in people's windows
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,In case you're at their table
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,What if your eyes looked up and met mine
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,One more time
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,You had stopped and tilted your head

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,"Now, now, now, now, now, now"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,I tried searching faces on streets
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,What are the chances you'd be
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,"Downtown, downtown, downtown"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,I Look in People?€?s Windows,Does it feel alright to not know me?

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Prophecy,Hand on the throttle
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Prophecy,Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Prophecy,"Oh, but it's gone again"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Prophecy,And it was written

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,I was in my new house placing daydreams
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,Patching up the crack along the wall
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,Cause that's where I was when I got the call
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,When the first stone's thrown there's screamin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,In the streets there's a ragin' riot
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,"When it's, ""Burn the bitch"", they're shrieking"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,When the truth comes out it's quiet

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,And tried to tell the town
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,"So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,Do you believe me now?
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,I was in my tower weaving nightmares
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,Twisting all my smiles into snarls
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,They say what doesn't kill you makes you aware
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,What happens if it becomes who you are?
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,So they killed Cassandra first
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,Cause she feared the worst
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,And tried to tell the town
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,"So they set my life in flames, I regret to say"

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,You can mark my words that I said it first
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,In a mourning warning no one heard
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,I patched up the crack along the wall
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,So they killed Cassandra first
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,Cause she feared the worst
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,And tried to tell the town
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,"So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say"

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,No one heard
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,Not a single word was heard
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,When the first stone's thrown there's screamin'
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,In the streets there's a ragin' riot
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,"When it's ""Burn the bitch"", they're shriekin'"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,When the truth comes out it's quiet
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Cassandra,It's so quiet
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,"Forgive me, Peter"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,My lost fearless leader
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,In closets like cedar
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Preserved from when we were just kids
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Is it somethin' I did?
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,The goddess of timing
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Once found us beguiling
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,She said she was trying
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,"Peter, was she lying?"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,My ribs get the feelin' she did
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,And I didn't want to come down
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,I thought it was just goodbye for now
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,You said you were gonna grow up
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Then you were gonna come find me
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Said you were gonna grow up

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Promises oceans deep
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,But never to keep
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,"Oh, never to keep"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Are you still a mind reader?
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,A natural scene stealer?
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,"I've heard great things, Peter"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,But life was always easier on you
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Than it was on me
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,And sometimes it gets me
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,When crossing your jet stream
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,In different galaxies
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,And I didn't want to hang around
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,We said it was just goodbye for now
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,You said you were gonna grow up

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Promises oceans deep
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,But never to keep
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Never to keep
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,And I won't confess that I waited
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,But I let the lamp burn
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,As the men masqueraded
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,I hoped you'd return
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,With your feet on the ground
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Tell me all that you'd learned
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,"And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Lost to the Lost Boys chapter of your life
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,"Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,To hold onto the days when you were mine (Hold onto the days)
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,You said you were gonna grow up
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Then you were gonna come find me
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,Peter,Said you were gonna grow up

THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,"By all accounts, she almost drowned"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,When she was six in frigid water
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,And I can confirm she made
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,"A curious child, ever reviled"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,By everyone except her own father
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,With a quite bewitching face
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,"Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,Excellent fun till you get to know her
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,Then she runs like it's a race
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,"Behind her back, her best mates laughed"
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,And they nicknamed her The Bolter
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,Started with a kiss
THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,The Bolter,"""Oh, we must stop meeting like this"""

Midnights,Maroon,When the morning came
Midnights,Maroon,We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
Midnights,Maroon,'Cause we lost track of time again
Midnights,Maroon,Laughing with my feet in your lap
Midnights,Maroon,Like you were my closest friend
Midnights,Maroon,"""How'd we end up???on???the???floor, anyway?"" you???say"
Midnights,Maroon,"""Your roommate's cheap-ass???screw-top ros??, that's how"""
Midnights,Maroon,I see you every day now
Midnights,Maroon,And I chose you
Midnights,Maroon,The one I was dancing with
Midnights,Maroon,"In New York, no shoes"
Midnights,Maroon,Looked up at the sky and it was
Midnights,Maroon,The burgundy on my t-shirt
Midnights,Maroon,When you splashed your wine into me
Midnights,Maroon,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
Midnights,Maroon,"So scarlet, it was"
Midnights,Maroon,The mark th??y saw on my collarbone
Midnights,Maroon,The rust that grew b??tween telephones
Midnights,Maroon,The lips I used to call home
Midnights,Maroon,"So scarlet, it was maroon"
Midnights,Maroon,When the silence came
Midnights,Maroon,"We were shaking, blind and hazy"
Midnights,Maroon,How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Midnights,Maroon,Sobbing with your head in your hands
Midnights,Maroon,Ain't that the way shit always ends?
Midnights,Maroon,You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Midnights,Maroon,"Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us"
Midnights,Maroon,"I feel you, no matter what"
Midnights,Maroon,The rubies that I gave up
Midnights,Maroon,And I lost you
Midnights,Maroon,The one I was dancing with
Midnights,Maroon,"In New York, no shoes"
Midnights,Maroon,Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
Midnights,Maroon,The burgundy on my t-shirt
Midnights,Maroon,When you splashed your wine into me
Midnights,Maroon,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
Midnights,Maroon,"So scarlet, it was (Maroon)"
Midnights,Maroon,The mark they saw on my collarbone
Midnights,Maroon,The rust that grew between telephones
Midnights,Maroon,The lips I used to call home
Midnights,Maroon,"So scarlet, it was maroon"
Midnights,Maroon,And I wake with your memory over me
Midnights,Maroon,"That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)"
Midnights,Maroon,And I wake with your memory over me
Midnights,Maroon,That's a real fucking legacy to leave
Midnights,Maroon,The burgundy on my t-shirt
Midnights,Maroon,When you splashed your wine into me
Midnights,Maroon,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
Midnights,Maroon,"So scarlet, it was maroon"
Midnights,Maroon,The mark they saw on my collarbone

Midnights,Mastermind,"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates"
Midnights,Mastermind,And all the stars aligned
Midnights,Mastermind,You and I ended up in the same room
Midnights,Mastermind,At the same time
Midnights,Mastermind,And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Midnights,Mastermind,Of a chain reaction of countermoves
Midnights,Mastermind,To assess the equation of you
Midnights,Mastermind,"Checkmate, I couldn't lose"
Midnights,Mastermind,What if I told you none of it was accidental?
Midnights,Mastermind,And the first night that you saw me
Midnights,Mastermind,Nothing was gonna stop me
Midnights,Mastermind,"I laid the groundwork, and then"
Midnights,Mastermind,Just like clockwork
Midnights,Mastermind,The dominoes cascaded in a line
Midnights,Mastermind,What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
Midnights,Mastermind,And now you're mine
Midnights,Mastermind,It was all by d??sign
Midnights,Mastermind,'Cause I'm a mastermind
Midnights,Mastermind,"You see, all the wis??st women"
Midnights,Mastermind,Had to do it this way
Midnights,Mastermind,'Cause we were born to be the pawn
Midnights,Mastermind,In every lover's game
Midnights,Mastermind,"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail"
Midnights,Mastermind,Strategy sets the scene for the tale
Midnights,Mastermind,I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
Midnights,Mastermind,And the liquor in our cocktails
Midnights,Mastermind,What if I told you none of it was accidental?
Midnights,Mastermind,And the first night that you saw me
Midnights,Mastermind,I knew I wanted your body
Midnights,Mastermind,"I laid the groundwork, and then"
Midnights,Mastermind,Just like clockwork
Midnights,Mastermind,The dominoes cascaded in a line
Midnights,Mastermind,What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
Midnights,Mastermind,And now you're mine
Midnights,Mastermind,It was all my design
Midnights,Mastermind,'Cause I'm a mastermind
Midnights,Mastermind,No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
Midnights,Mastermind,So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
Midnights,Mastermind,To make them love me and make it seem effortless
Midnights,Mastermind,This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
Midnights,Mastermind,And I swear
Midnights,Mastermind,I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
Midnights,Mastermind,'Cause I care
Midnights,Mastermind,So I told you none of it was accidental
Midnights,Mastermind,And the first night that you saw me
Midnights,Mastermind,Nothing was gonna stop me
Midnights,Mastermind,"I laid the groundwork, and then"
Midnights,Mastermind,Saw a wide smirk on your face
Midnights,Mastermind,You knew the entire time
Midnights,Mastermind,You knew that I'm a mastermind
Midnights,Mastermind,And now you're mine
Midnights,Mastermind,"Yeah, all you did was smile"
Midnights,Mastermind,'Cause I'm a mastermind
Midnights,Midnight Rain,Rain
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted a bride, I was making my own name"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"Chasing that fame, he stayed the same"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,All of me changed like midnight
Midnights,Midnight Rain,My town was a wasteland
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"Full of cages, full of fences"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,Pageant queens and big pretenders
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"But for some, it was paradise"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,My boy was a montage
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"A slow-motion, love potion"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,Jumping off things in the ocean
Midnights,Midnight Rain,I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He was sunshine, I was midnight rain"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted a bride, I was making my own name"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"Chasing that fame, he stayed the same"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,All of me changed like midnight
Midnights,Midnight Rain,It came like a postcard
Midnights,Midnight Rain,Picture perfect shiny family
Midnights,Midnight Rain,Holiday peppermint candy
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"But for him, it's every day"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,So I peered through a window
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"A deep portal, time travel"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,All the love we unravel
Midnights,Midnight Rain,And the life I gave away
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted a bride, I was making my own name"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"Chasing that fame, he stayed the same"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,All of me changed like midnight rain
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"He wanted a bride, I was making my own name"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"Chasing that fame, he stayed the same"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,All of me changed like midnight
Midnights,Midnight Rain,I guess sometimes we all get
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"Just what we wanted, just what we wanted"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,And he never thinks of me
Midnights,Midnight Rain,Except for when I'm on TV
Midnights,Midnight Rain,I guess sometimes we all get
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted"
Midnights,Midnight Rain,And I never think of him
Midnights,Midnight Rain,Except on midnights like this
Midnights,Midnight Rain,"(Midnights like this, midnights like this)"
Midnights,Paris,"""Your ex-friend's sister"
Midnights,Paris,Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Midnights,Paris,"Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago"
Midnights,Paris,Some wannabe Z-lister
Midnights,Paris,And all the outfits were terrible
Midnights,Paris,2003 unbearable
Midnights,Paris,"Did you see the photos?"""
Midnights,Paris,"No, I didn't, but thanks, though"
Midnights,Paris,I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Midnights,Paris,Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
Midnights,Paris,"No, I didn't see the news"
Midnights,Paris,'Cause we were somewhere else
Midnights,Paris,Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Midnights,Paris,"Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne"
Midnights,Paris,I was taken by the view
Midnights,Paris,Like we were in Paris
Midnights,Paris,Like we were somewhere else
Midnights,Paris,"Like we were in Paris, oh"
Midnights,Paris,We were somewhere else
Midnights,Paris,Privacy sign on the door
Midnights,Paris,And on my page and on the whole world
Midnights,Paris,Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Midnights,Paris,Levitate above all the messes made
Midnights,Paris,Sit quiet by my side in the shade
Midnights,Paris,And not the kind that's thrown
Midnights,Paris,"I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown"
Midnights,Paris,I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Midnights,Paris,Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
Midnights,Paris,"No, I didn't see the news"
Midnights,Paris,'Cause we were somewhere else
Midnights,Paris,Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Midnights,Paris,"Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne"

Midnights,Paris,"Like we were in Paris, oh"
Midnights,Paris,Like we were somewhere else
Midnights,Paris,"Like we were in Paris, oh"
Midnights,Paris,We were somewhere else
Midnights,Paris,I wanna brainwash you
Midnights,Paris,Into loving me forever
Midnights,Paris,I wanna transport you
Midnights,Paris,To somewhere the culture's clever
Midnights,Paris,Confess my truth
Midnights,Paris,"In swooping, sloping, cursive letters"
Midnights,Paris,Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
Midnights,Paris,In my mind
Midnights,Paris,We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
Midnights,Paris,"No, I didn't see the news"
Midnights,Paris,'Cause we were somewhere else
Midnights,Paris,"In an alleyway, drinking champagne"
Midnights,Paris,'Cause we were in Paris
Midnights,Paris,"Yes, we were somewhere else"
Midnights,Paris,"My love, we were in Paris"
Midnights,Paris,"Yes, we were somewhere else"

Midnights,The Great War,My knuckles were bruised like violets
Midnights,The Great War,"Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked"
Midnights,The Great War,Spineless in my tomb of silence
Midnights,The Great War,"Tore your banners down, took the battle underground"
Midnights,The Great War,And maybe it was egos swinging
Midnights,The Great War,Maybe it was her

Midnights,The Great War,You said I have to trust more freely
Midnights,The Great War,"But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire"
Midnights,The Great War,And maybe it's the past that's talking
Midnights,The Great War,Screaming from the crypt

Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),The street looks when it's just rained
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car"
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"In the middle of the parking lot, yeah"
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, yeah"
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know"
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair"
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),Absent-mindedly making me want you

Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh"
Fearless,Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"Oh-oh, yeah"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),It's the mornin' of your very first day
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Try and stay out of everybody's way
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),For the next four years in this town
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"""You know, I haven't seen you around before"""
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),You're gonna believe them
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"Well, count to ten, take it in"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),At fifteen
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"And soon enough, you're best friends"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),We'll be outta here as soon as we can
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And you're feelin' like flyin'
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),When the night ends
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),You're gonna believe them
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"Makes your head spin around, well"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),In your life you'll do things greater than
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Datin' the boy on the football team
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),I didn't know it at fifteen
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),When all you wanted was to be wanted
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And Abigail gave everything she had
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),To a boy who changed his mind
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And we both cried
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),You're gonna believe them
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),But I've found time can heal most anything
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),And you just might find who you're supposed to be
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),I didn't know who I was supposed to be
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),At fifteen
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"La-la-la, la-la-la"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Your very first day
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),"Take a deep breath, girl"
Fearless,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),We were both young when I first saw you
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),I'm standing there
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),On a balcony in summer air
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),See you make your way through the crowd
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"And say, ""Hello"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),Little did I know
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),And I was crying on the staircase
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),So I sneak out to the garden to see you
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),So close your eyes
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),But you were everything to me
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"This love is difficult, but it's real"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),And I got tired of waiting
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),Wondering if you were ever coming around
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),My faith in you was fading
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),When I met you on the outskirts of town
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),I love you and that's all I really know
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"""
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh, oh"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, oh, oh"
Fearless,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Fearless,Hey Stephen (Taylor’s Version),"Mmm-mm, mm-mm"

Fearless,Forever & Always (Taylor’s Version),And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
Fearless,Forever & Always (Taylor’s Version),"And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always"""
Fearless,Forever & Always (Taylor’s Version),"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom"

Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),"Look now, the sky is gold"
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),I don't know why all the trees change in the fall

Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),I'm thirteen now
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),And don't know how my friends could be so mean
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you

Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),And I had the best days with you
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),There is a video I found from back when I was three
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Fearless,The Best Day (Taylor’s Version),Daddy's smart

Fearless,Change (Taylor’s Version),"You know it’s all the same, another time and place"
Fearless,Change (Taylor’s Version),Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
Fearless,Change (Taylor’s Version),But I believe in whatever you do
